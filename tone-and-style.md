### A Style Guide for Impactful Content

* **Plain, Direct Language:** You favor content that is clear, factual, and free of fluff. You want to avoid abstract or vague terms, replacing them with concrete examples. Your goal is for the reader to immediately understand the message without needing to interpret jargon. This is evident in your push to replace "enhanced with business observability" with the more direct "made observable in business terms."

* **Strategic Use of Industry Terminology:** While you prefer plain language, you recognize that some industry terms, like **Product Owner** or **functional requirements**, are well-understood by your audience and should be used where appropriate. The key is to use them when they add precision, not when they create ambiguity.

* **Contrast-Driven Messaging:** You believe the most effective way to explain a new concept is to highlight the contrast between a traditional approach and the new one. This is seen in how you frame business observability as a solution to a problem, contrasting the old way of knowing "Service X is down" with the new way of knowing a system isn't "doing what the business needs."

* **Diagnostic and Revealing Content:** You value content that's not just informative but also encourages critical thinking. Your use of a diagnostic question, "how do you know the service is doing what it's supposed to do for the business?", is a great example of this. It's designed to reveal a gap in someone's thinking and open the door for a solution.

* **Structure That Guides:** You've emphasized that the content's structure is as important as the words themselves. Your prompt's design, which moves a user from a high-level concept to specific, measurable outcomes, shows that you prefer a logical flow that guides users toward a desired mental model. The structure itself is a tool for understanding.
