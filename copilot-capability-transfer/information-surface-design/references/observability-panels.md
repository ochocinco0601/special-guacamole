## 1. The observability narrowing

For observability surfaces, the general chain takes a fixed shape — five
positions. Every panel projects some subset of these:

| # | Position | The question it answers | Example (SRE) | Example (business) |
|---|----------|------------------------|---------------|--------------------|
| 1 | **Who cares** | Who has the responsibility? | On-call SRE | VP of Origination |
| 2 | **Why they care** | What responsibility creates the need? | Keep checkout API available | Loans processed within SLA |
| 3 | **What they expect** | What's the target/threshold? | p99 < 200ms, errors < 0.1% | Completion within window |
| 4 | **How it's measured** | What metric resolves the uncertainty? | Latency percentiles, 5xx rate | On-time completion rate |
| 5 | **What it's about** | The thing observed, at what altitude? | Checkout API (application) | Origination process (business) |

The "someone" is **anyone with a responsibility that creates an expectation about
something measurable.**

### The observability diagnostic (the engine's general diagnostic, in this skin)

| # | Position | Ask | Healthy | Common failure |
|---|----------|-----|---------|----------------|
| 1 | Who cares | Stakeholders named? | Named with role context | Implied by the title, or absent |
| 2 | Why they care | Drivers/expectations stated? | Explicit expectation per stakeholder | "Everyone knows why uptime matters" |
| 3 | What they expect | Targets defined? | Numeric threshold with owner | Traffic light with invisible threshold |
| 4 | How it's measured | Current state shown *against* target? | value + target + delta + status | Raw number, no context (is 409 bad?) |
| 5 | What it's about | Altitude clear? | Named layer + appropriate framework | Business labels on infrastructure data |

**Bonus — impact chain.** When health degrades, does the surface show what happens
next (customers affected, revenue at risk, compliance exposure, operational
backlog)? Absence here is the *"system healthy but business failing"* blind spot —
the most expensive gap.

---

## 2. The triage / troubleshooting chain

Incident triage is not one panel — it is a **chain** of the engine's instances, in
a natural order (ITIL 4 Incident Management). Each question produces one panel;
each resolves one decision and hands off to the next:

| Step | Plain question | Decision it unlocks |
|------|----------------|---------------------|
| 0 | *(detection — something looks wrong)* | — |
| 1 | **Is it healthy?** | act or move on |
| 2 | **What specifically?** | narrow focus |
| 3 | **What's the business impact?** | urgency |
| 4 | **Why is it red?** | remedy / root cause |
| 5 | **What else is affected?** | blast radius / scope |
| 6 | **Who do I call?** | escalate / ownership |
| 7 | **What's the fix?** | resolve (runbook) |

The consumer does **not** need to know the machinery behind the panel. They need
the panel to carry enough context to decide and move to the next question.

---

## 3. Production machinery

How a walked chain becomes a *buildable* panel spec, every field traceable to a
named standard. Use it when you move from "what should this show" to "what exactly
do I render, from what data."

**Governing standards (name them — they carry the rules):** ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010
(viewpoints/concerns), ArchiMate 3.2 (the element graph), OpenSLO
(targets/thresholds), ITIL 4 (the triage flow), APQC / Google Golden Signals / USE
(health dimensions by altitude), Nagios (worst-child health propagation), COSO ERM
(exhaustive impact categories), Tufte / Few / Norman (rendering).

### 3.1 The traversal architecture

Every panel's data is a traversal through a fixed graph of ArchiMate elements.
Positions 1–4 are the **motivation core** — *altitude-independent,* identical at
every level. Positions 5–6 are the **subject extension** —
*altitude-parameterized.* Positions 7–9 are optional branches.

```
Motivation core  (altitude-INDEPENDENT — proven across all altitudes):

  [1] Stakeholder ──Association──▶ [2] Driver ──Realization──▶
  [3] Requirement ──Realization──▶ [4] Outcome ──Influence(±)──▶

Subject extension  (altitude-PARAMETERIZED — type binding per altitude):

  [5] Subject ──Access/Serving──▶ [6] Object

Optional branches:

  [5] ──Assignment──▶ [7] BusinessRole ──Assignment──▶ [8] BusinessActor   (ownership / "who do I call")
  [3] ──Association──▶ [9] Runbook (BusinessObject)                         (the fix)
```

Mapping to §1: position 1 = *who cares*, 2 = *why*, 3 = *what they expect* (carries
the target), 4 = *the measured outcome*, 5–6 = *what it's about.*

### 3.2 Altitude bindings

Only positions 5–6 change by altitude. Three bindings, all proven:

| Altitude | Position 5 (Subject) | Position 6 (Object) | Relationship 5→6 |
|----------|----------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Business** | `archimate:BusinessProcess` | `archimate:BusinessObject` | `archimate:Access` |
| **Application** | `archimate:ApplicationService` | `archimate:BusinessProcess` | `archimate:Serving` |
| **Technology** | `archimate:TechnologyService` | `archimate:ApplicationService` | `archimate:Serving` |

### 3.3 Health dimensions by altitude

What "healthy" *means* depends on altitude — use the altitude-appropriate
framework:

| Altitude | Health framework | Dimensions |
|----------|------------------|------------|
| **Business** | APQC Process Performance | Effectiveness, Efficiency, Adaptability |
| **Application** | Google Golden Signals | Latency, Errors, Traffic, Saturation |
| **Technology** | USE Method | Utilization, Saturation, Errors |

### 3.4 Projection rules — one traversal, many panels

The same data chain answers many questions by varying **which positions project
onto the panel.** "Is it healthy?" projects measurement + target. "What's the
business impact?" projects stakeholder + consequence. *Same data, different
display.* Define the traversal once, add questions cheaply via new projections.
Seven proven patterns:

1. **One-to-one, single altitude** — one subject, one panel.
2. **One-to-many fan-out** — one parent projects to many children.
3. **Aggregation (worst-child)** — children roll up to one tile via Nagios
   worst-case propagation.
4. **Same-altitude decomposition** — parent → children via ArchiMate Composition
   (full context for degraded children, name-only for healthy).
5. **Cross-altitude composition** — application → business via Serving; no new
   element types.
6. **Vendor-boundary projection** — traversal crosses an org/vendor boundary.
7. **Comparison / small multiples** — cohort comparison across peer subjects.

### 3.5 Coloring a tile

Use the **two-threshold pattern** (Nagios): a warning threshold and a critical
threshold, both explicit, both from OpenSLO. Never render a traffic light whose
thresholds are invisible (fails diagnostic position 3).

### 3.6 The grounding rule (non-negotiable)

**Every field on a panel must trace to named prior art, or be explicitly marked as
a gap.** Use element types and field names from published specs, in their real
namespaces (`archimate:name`, `openslo:target`, `dcterms:source`). When a concept
is needed but no framework is identified, label it `prior-art-unresolved` with a
pointer — do not silently invent. **Tie-breaker** when multiple standards apply:
(1) frameworks already adopted in BOS → (2) native domain framework →
(3) simplicity → (4) wide adoption.

## 4. Formed design opinions — multi-workflow business apps

These are layout opinions **already resolved against real cases.** They are the
current "what good looks like" for the live need this instance is applied to:
**real business applications that contain multiple workflows.** Treat them as
defaults. *Status:* Proven = validated against real cases or a practitioner build;
Design decision = committed, not yet shipped; Hypothesis = validated in analysis,
not yet built. Don't present a Hypothesis as settled fact.

### The governing case

A real business application is rarely one process. A lending app spans
origination → underwriting → closing → servicing; an originations flow is itself
6+ sequential steps. The naive reader's job is *"is the business healthy, and if
not, where?"* **A single rolled-up health tile destroys that** — it says
"something's wrong" but not "where, in which flow, with what downstream effect." So:

> **Lay the surface out as workflows, and within each workflow as ordered steps.
> Carry health per-workflow and per-step — not one aggregate tile. The naive
> reader needs the structure *visible upfront*, not hidden behind a roll-up they
> must drill to reconstruct.**

### The opinions

| # | Opinion | Layout implication | Status |
|---|---------|--------------------|--------|
| 1 | **Sequential steps, not parallel peers.** A step-3 failure *blocks* steps 4–6. | Left-to-right pipeline; give a gated step a distinct **BLOCKED** state vs **DEGRADED** (own failure) vs **HEALTHY**. | Proven |
| 2 | **A step's health rule is a business decision, not a roll-up.** One step may depend on several services with *different* criticality (fraud down = blocking; credit-risk down = degraded-but-proceed). | Each step owns an explicit composition rule (blocking / degradable / optional), authored once by the process owner, applied mechanically. Don't worst-case everything to red. | Design decision |
| 3 | **Structure visible upfront for naive readers.** | First view shows *all* steps (the pipeline), not "1 CRITICAL · 2 WARNING" cards that hide the flow. | Principle (validated) |
| 4 | **Journey is per-workflow, owned, its own view.** Each workflow has a name, a business question, an owner, ordered steps. | Each workflow gets its own view/section — never all workflows compressed into one generic "journey." | Design decision |
| 5 | **Journey is a *perspective on* a service, not a replacement.** Service home answers "is this service healthy?"; journey view answers "where in the flow is the problem?" | Service home is the hub (health + context, always on); the flow view is reachable *from* it, for process-shaped services. | Design decision |
| 6 | **Heterogeneous steps stay coherent when self-contained.** Steps measure different things (success rate vs timeliness vs coverage). | Don't fuse into one score. Each step is a self-contained micro-panel with its own labeled measurement; the step's outcome label is load-bearing. | Proven |
| 7 | **Enumerate up to ~7, aggregate above.** (Few's data density + Miller's 7±2.) | ≤7 items: show all equally. >7: headline aggregation + grouped/collapsible detail. | Proven |
| 8 | **Signal → stakeholder → impact must be visually direct.** "This signal is critical" is half the meaning; whose expectation and what cost is the other half. | Carry stakeholder + impact inline with each signal (chips/badges), not in a separate section. | Design principle |
| 9 | **Health is scoped to the *need*; a signal's role is contextual.** The same signal can be *outcome* for one need and *diagnostic* for another. | Label a signal with its role in context ("Outcome for *detection*"), not a fixed global label. | Hypothesis |

### How this plugs into the method

These are the *answers* to Step 4 of the design method (vague → satisfy) for the
multi-workflow case: decompose into workflows (4), lay each out as an ordered
pipeline (1, 3), give each step a business-authored health rule (2, 6), keep
signal→impact inline (8), respect the ~7 boundary (7). The worked example below is
single-process; scale it by stacking one such chain per workflow step.

---

## 5. Worked example (end to end)

**Vague description:** *"What is the health of the Document Generation process?"*

**Step 1 — Narrow** (decide the axes before traversing):

| Axis | Choice | Catalog term |
|------|--------|--------------|
| Altitude | Business process | `archimate:BusinessProcess` |
| Health dimension | On-time delivery rate | APQC — Effectiveness |
| Time scope | Snapshot, rolling 24h | Snapshot |
| View type | RAG at-a-glance | Operational (Few) |

**Step 2 — Traverse** (business-altitude binding):

```
[1] Stakeholder  = Regulator
[2] Driver       = Regulatory Compliance
[3] Requirement  = "Closing Disclosure delivered within 3-day window"
                     dcterms:source           = "12 CFR 1026.19(f)(1)(ii)"
                     openslo:target           = 100
                     openslo:warningThreshold = 95
                     openslo:operator         = "gte"
[4] Outcome      = "CD on-time delivery rate"
                     openslo:indicator.metricSource = Prometheus
                     openslo:reportingWindow        = 24h rolling
[5] Subject      = Document Generation (archimate:BusinessProcess)
[6] Object       = Closing Disclosure (archimate:BusinessObject)   via archimate:Access
```

**Step 3 — Project** to the "is it healthy?" panel: measurement (4) + target (3) +
RAG status. When degraded, the impact projection adds stakeholder (1) + consequence.

**Step 4 — Render** so it passes the acceptance gates:

> **Document Generation — Closing Disclosure on-time delivery**
> 🔴 **93%** (target ≥ 95%) · rolling 24h
> **TRID — Closing Disclosure delayed past 3-day window — 7 customers affected**
> → *Next: why is it red?* (root-cause panel) · *Who do I call?* (ownership)

That last line satisfies **combinatorial meaning** (regulation + deadline + impact
+ count) and **handoff** (paths to triage steps 4 and 6). A consumer who has never
heard of TRID can still decide: red, regulatory deadline miss, 7 customers
affected — escalate.

*Everything in this file is the information-surface-design engine instantiated for
observability. The engine generalizes; this is its most fully validated
application — demonstrated end-to-end across 21 worked examples spanning 8 banking
domains (mortgage origination, card authorization, ACH, credit decisioning,
e-commerce checkout, and vendor-integrated flows), all three altitudes, and both
real-time and batch, with no structural exceptions. That is why the patterns in §4
are given as defaults, not suggestions.*
